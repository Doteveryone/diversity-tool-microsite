title: How diverse is your organisation?
---

We think organisations can become better by becoming more diverse. A step towards becoming more diverse is to find out how diverse your organisation currently is, and to share the results.

Reporting on diversity is tricky for small organisations. It's hard to know what the right thing to ask is, what to share and how to display the results.

This is tool exists to make it easier.

## Asking Questions

We've created a survey that can be used to find out more about an organisation's diversity.

It helps see how an organisation is doing in five areas: gender, age, LGBT-inclusion, disability and ethnicity.

It's available as a Google Form that can be reused for your organisation.
