## A diversity monitoring tool for small organisations

Monitoring the diversity of an organisation can be difficult. What do you mean by diversity? What should you monitor? What are you comparing yourself against? How do you ask the questions? These are not straightforward questions to answer.

When you're in a small organisation it gets tricker. You don't have an HR department, so there's probably no-one with direct expertise in this kind of process, so you worry more; are we asking the right thing? are we doing this right? how do we start?

Small organisations also have an extra concern — when the numbers you report can be mapped so directly to individuals do you risk breaching confidences?

This prototype is our answer to those questions.

## 1. Survey your organisation

<aside>A screenshot of the survey goes here</aside>

We've created a survey that can be used to find out more about your organisation's diversity.

It's available as a Google Form that can be reused for your organisation.

[Get the form, and find out more about how to use it &rarr;](/survey-your-organisation)

## 2. Share your results

Once you've surveyed your members anonymously, share the aggregate results publicly.

We've created a tool to turn the results of the Google Form above into a series of charts.

## 3. Find out how to improve

Finding out how diverse your organisation is is only a starting point. Next you'll need to interpret what this means, and how to improve.

We gathered a [list of resources](/how-to-improve) that can help you decide what your next steps should be.
