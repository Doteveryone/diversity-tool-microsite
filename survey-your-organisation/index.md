We prepared a set of questions that can be sent to members of your organisation to get an overview of your diversity.

## How to use this form

We prepared a Google Form that you can copy and send to your employees. It asks a few questions we think can help you gauge how to improve.

### Downsides of using a Google Form

Google Forms are free to use, easy to share, and easy to duplicate, but they aren’t perfect. Some downsides are:

- The label next to the free text option on each question reads “Other”, which is far from ideal when asking about identities. It cannot be changed to something more appropriate, for example “Self-described”.
- They require the organisation to already use Google services internally.
- The results are stored by Google, and depending on your company policies this may not be acceptable.

## What to say when sending out the form

When sending out the form it’s important that you are clear why you are asking these questions and that you address potential concerns.

Our research shows us that responders concerns fall into the following categories:
- wanting to know why personal questions are being asked
- wanting to understand exactly how the data will be stored and used, which may affect how they choose to answer
- wanting to have some control over revealing personal information publicly even if it’s done in aggregate

We chose to prioritise the individual’s right to protect their privacy when visualising data. Read more about [how we did it and what that means](/protecting-individuals-privacy).

## Why we ask these questions
