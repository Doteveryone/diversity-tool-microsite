title: Why we ask these questions
---

This tool is meant to measure how your organisation is doing, not to provide an accurate census of your employees’ identities. This distinction dictated our question choices, phrasing, and the answers available.

We ask questions that highlight where you might need to improve, but they might not give you very accurate, granular data. We think that in a small organisation that’s fine.

## Question one

A short explanation of why we chose it. One or two sentences might be enough, but sometimes <a href="#">there will be a link</a>.

## Tell us how to improve

We want to hear from you if you can suggest improvements to the survey questions.
